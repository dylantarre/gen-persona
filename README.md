## Installation

### Using Docker Hub

The easiest way to get started is to pull the pre-built Docker image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull dylantarre/gen-persona:latest
```

Then run it with:

```bash
docker run -p 9350:9350 -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key dylantarre/gen-persona:latest
```

### Using Docker Compose

1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed

2. Create and configure your `.env` file as described above

3. Build and run the container:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Portainer Deployment

1. In Portainer, go to "Stacks" and click "Add stack"
2. Upload the `docker-compose.yml` file or paste its contents
3. Add your environment variables:
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: Your OpenRouter API key
4. Deploy the stack

## API Usage

The service runs on port 9350 and exposes two endpoints:

### Generate Persona

**Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:9350/generate`

**Headers:**
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "base_persona": "Your persona description here"
}
```

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9350/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "base_persona": "A 28-year-old software engineer who loves rock climbing and building side projects in their spare time. They are passionate about clean code and sustainable development practices."
  }'
```

### Health Check

**Endpoint:** `GET http://localhost:9350/health`

**Example:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:9350/health
```

## Best Practices for Using the Service

### Writing Effective Base Personas

1. **Be Specific**: Include key demographic information, interests, and behaviors
   ```json
   {
     "base_persona": "A 35-year-old marketing manager in Toronto with two kids. They work remotely, are tech-savvy, and struggle with work-life balance."
   }
   ```

2. **Include Context**: Add relevant professional or personal context
   ```json
   {
     "base_persona": "A freelance graphic designer transitioning from print to digital design. They have 10 years of experience but feel overwhelmed by new design tools."
   }
   ```

3. **Add Pain Points**: Mention challenges or frustrations
   ```json
   {
     "base_persona": "A small business owner who finds digital marketing confusing. They want to grow their online presence but have limited time and budget."
   }
   ```

### Integration Examples

**Python:**
```python
import requests

def generate_persona(base_persona):
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:9350/generate",
        json={"base_persona": base_persona}
    )
    return response.json()
```

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
async function generatePersona(basePersona) {
    const response = await fetch('http://localhost:9350/generate', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({ base_persona: basePersona })
    });
    return await response.json();
}
```

### Error Handling

The API returns standard HTTP status codes:
- 200: Success
- 400: Bad Request (invalid input)
- 500: Internal Server Error

Always implement proper error handling in your applications:

```python
try:
    response = requests.post(
        "http://localhost:9350/generate",
        json={"base_persona": base_persona}
    )
    response.raise_for_status()
    persona = response.json()
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"Error generating persona: {e}")
```

## Monitoring

The service includes a health check endpoint that can be used for monitoring:

```bash
# Using curl
curl http://localhost:9350/health

# Using wget
wget -qO- http://localhost:9350/health
```

Docker Compose is configured to perform automatic health checks every 30 seconds.

## Rate Limiting

Be mindful of OpenRouter's rate limits. Consider implementing your own rate limiting if you're making multiple requests:

```python
import time

def generate_multiple_personas(base_personas, delay_seconds=1):
    results = []
    for persona in base_personas:
        result = generate_persona(persona)
        results.append(result)
        time.sleep(delay_seconds)  # Rate limiting
    return results
```
